* AirStatus Auto Hide

A small script to enable/disable [[https://github.com/delphiki/gnome-airpods-battery-status][Airpods Battery Status]] GNOME Shell Extension automatically, based on whether Airpods are connected or not.

The script simply checks if any device containing "AirPods" in its name is connected every 10 seconds, using =bluetoothctl= and enables/disables the extension appropriately.

Let me know if there is a better way to do this, this was a 5 minute hack.

** Requirements

-  [[https://github.com/delphiki/gnome-airpods-battery-status][Airpods Battery Status]]
-  [[https://github.com/delphiki/AirStatus][AirStatus]]

** Usage

Either run the script every time you log in, or automate it. I'm using Ubuntu's Startup Applications.
